# Traveling salesman problem with selenium scraper

In this project was developed a scraper bot using selenium. This bot automatize the route search process between each pair in a set of locations using Open Street Maps. The bot also write the correspondent TSP optimization problem using the Miller, Tucker, and Zemlin formulation in AMPL to send the problem to the neos server and get the solution. Its also provided a simple colony ant optimization implementation to get rasonable good solutions without using the NEOS server.
